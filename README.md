  # Project - 2 Mix 'n' Match
  
  ## Description
  
  * This application is a simple dating app that allows users to match with other uses based on mutual beer preference and people with similar desired pronouns. Users are able to sign up and create a profile after being asked questions like name, pronoun, desired pronoun, age, city, hobbies, beer type, and profile picture, among others. Upon signing in with their newly created credentials, users will land at a dashboard where they will view suggested matches based on beer preference and pronouns. The matches cards show profile picture

  * For future development, we would like to add matching capability when two users mutaully "cheers" eachother. When this happens, more information about the users will appear. We would also like to implement chat functionality and potentially a beer API so that the conversation can continue. An even further expansion could be into adding cocktails or other alcoholic beverages as a commonality.
